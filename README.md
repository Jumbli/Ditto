Tips
----
Make sure your controllers are put away, the app only uses hand tracking.
Ensure the floor level is accurately represented in your Guardian.
The game uses hand tracking, passthrough and extensive voice input to perform most interactions.
To activate the mic, use your gaze-based pointer to highlight the mic icon.
The mic icon follows you around to make it easier to highlight.
Move your gaze away from the icon when you finish talking to transmit the request.
When moving objects, ensure your hand is visible to the tracking cameras on the Quest and grip with the full hand.
